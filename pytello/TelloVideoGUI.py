"""
DroneVisionGUI is a new class that parallels DroneVision but with several important changes.

1) This module uses VLC instead of FFMPEG
2) This module opens a GUI window to show you the video in real-time (you could
watch it in real-time previously through the VisionServer)
3) Because GUI windows are different on different OS's (and in particular OS X behaves differently
than linux and windows) and because they want to run in the main program thread, the way your program runs
is different.  You first open the GUI and then you have the GUI spawn a thread to run your program.
4) This module can use a virtual disk in memory to save the images, thus shortening the time delay for the
camera for your programs.

    Modification of the simple Media Player using VLC and Qt
    to show the mambo stream

    The window part of this example was modified from the QT example cited below.
    VLC requires windows to create and show the video and this was a cross-platform solution.
    VLC will automatically create the windows in linux but not on the mac.
